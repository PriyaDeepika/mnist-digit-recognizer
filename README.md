# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognizer using CNN (MNIST)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.  
The model achieves an impressive **99.10% validation accuracy** by applying dropout regularization and data augmentation.
